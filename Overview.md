This whole vault is written and maintained for the **Linux Device Driver** experiments on **Raspberry Pi 5**. There are multiple sources to learn this but I did not find any of them descriptive in terms of execution and concept explanation. There are some web-pages which may explain a particular part in a wonderful way, but they can not teach from "A to Z".

I am writing this in terms of my own understanding and the way I proceed while learning *Linux Device Drivers* using *Raspberry Pi 5*. I had some hands-on experience and knowledge about Linux Device Drivers for i.MX7D processor. But I lost the track of it so to get into the world of LDD again, I thought to experiment it with RPi 5.

Experiments section has several programs those are tested and executed on RPi , and not on any emulator like QEMU. But one can use emulators in case unavailability of hardware. Although the results may change or some of the errors may occur. I shall try to maintain another section for QEMU execution.

All important web-links, forum sections, books, and documents are mentioned in the [[References]] section. Some of the web-links may disappear in case they are not maintained. I shall try to keep them updated as quickly as possible. If you find any better reference, add it.

Linux Internals has all the required information for the concepts of Linux OS, which are beyond the kernel. I have written them in simplified version along with the questions those arose to me while I was working with these experiments. Understand that these are essential concepts and won't make an expert in Linux. :P
